# Overview
1. **Command-Line Arguments:**
    - `-prompt`: The prompt you want to send to the OpenAI API.
    - `-repos`: A comma-separated list of GitHub repository URLs you want to include in the context.

2. **Cloning Repositories:**
    - The script clones each repository into the `./cloned_repos` directory if it hasn’t been cloned already.
    - If the repository is already cloned, it performs a `git pull` to fetch the latest changes.

3. **Aggregating Code:**
    - It traverses each cloned repository, reads all code files based on predefined extensions, and aggregates their content.
    - The aggregated code is stored in the session context under the repository’s name.

4. **Session Context:**
    - The session context is maintained in a `session_context.json` file.
    - On each run, the script loads the existing context, updates it with any new code from the repositories, and saves it back.

5. **Preparing Context for OpenAI:**
    - All aggregated code from the repositories is combined into a single string, formatted with Markdown headers and code blocks for clarity.

6. **Sending Request to OpenAI:**
    - The script constructs a request payload containing the combined context and the user’s prompt.
    - It sends this payload to the OpenAI API’s Chat Completion endpoint.
    - The response from OpenAI is then printed to the terminal.

# Usage Instructions

1. **Save the Script:**
    - Save the above script as `morpheus_integration.go`.

2. **Set OpenAI API Key:**
    - Export your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
      ```bash
      export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
      ```

3. **Build the Script:**
    - Open your terminal, navigate to the directory containing `morpheus_integration.go`, and build the executable:
      ```bash
      go build -o morpheus_integration morpheus_integration.go
      ```

4. **Run the Script:**
    - Use the built executable to send a prompt along with GitHub repository URLs.
    - **Example:**
      ```bash
      ./morpheus_integration -prompt="How can I improve the session management in the main.go file?" -repos="https://github.com/Lumerin-protocol/Morpheus-Lumerin-Node.git,https://github.com/another-user/another-repo.git"
      ```

5. **View the Response:**
    - The script will output the response from ChatGPT based on the provided context and prompt.

## Notes and Considerations

- **Repository Size:** Large repositories with extensive codebases can lead to large context sizes, which may exceed OpenAI’s token limits. Consider limiting the scope of repositories or implementing code summarization.
- **API Costs:** Interacting with the OpenAI API incurs costs based on the number of tokens processed. Monitor your usage to manage expenses.
- **File Types:** The script currently considers a predefined set of code file extensions. Modify the `isCodeFile` function to include or exclude specific file types as needed.
- **Error Handling:** The script includes basic error handling. For production use, consider enhancing it to handle more edge cases and provide more informative feedback.
- **Session Context Management:** The current implementation aggregates all code into the session context. Depending on your use case, you might want to implement more sophisticated context management, such as indexing code files or summarizing them.
- **Concurrency:** For multiple repositories, cloning and processing can be time-consuming. Consider implementing concurrency to handle multiple repositories in parallel.

## Enhancements

Here are some potential enhancements you can make to the script:

1. **Code Summarization:** Integrate a summarization step to condense large codebases before sending them to the OpenAI API.
2. **Selective File Inclusion:** Allow users to specify which directories or file types to include or exclude.
3. **Interactive Mode:** Implement an interactive mode where users can input prompts in real-time without restarting the script.
4. **Logging:** Enhance logging to provide more detailed insights into the script’s operations.
5. **Configuration File:** Use a configuration file to manage settings like clone directory, session context file, and API parameters.
6. **Advanced Error Handling:** Implement retries for transient errors and more granular error messages.

## Conclusion

This Go script provides a foundational tool for integrating multiple GitHub repositories’ code into a context that can be processed by the OpenAI API based on user prompts. It streamlines the process of fetching and maintaining repository code, ensuring that your interactions with the API are informed by the latest codebase state.

Feel free to modify and enhance the script to better fit your specific needs and workflows. If you encounter any issues or have further questions, don’t hesitate to ask!
